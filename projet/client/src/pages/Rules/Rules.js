                                                                He has one or more cards of the same value and places them on top, thus skipping the next player's turn.
                                                            </li>

                                                    <li>
                                                        The turn ends when no more player can place a card, the last player to have deposited one begins the next turn.

                                                        To win, you just need to be the first to run out of cards. When this happens, the game must continue until there is only one player left with cards.
